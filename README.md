### Bachelor Thesis: Computational Analysis of viral-host protein interactions: focus on E7 & POU5F1.

Researched and implemented a Python pipeline for the analysis of in-house and publicly available genomics and proteomics data. Regulatory and protein interaction networks were constructed and visualized within
CytoScape to extract information about a specific protein complex.
